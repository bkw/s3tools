.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Some of the below specified options can have their default 
values set in 
.B s3cmd
config file (by default $HOME/.s3cmd). As it's a simple text file 
feel free to open it with your favorite text editor and do any
changes you like.
.PP
Config file related options.
.TP
\fB\-\-configure\fR
Invoke interactive (re)configuration tool. Don't worry, you won't 
lose your settings on subsequent runs.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR FILE, \fB\-\-config\fR=FILE
Config file name. Defaults to $HOME/.s3cfg
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\-config\fR
Dump current configuration after parsing config files
and command line options and exit.
.PP
Most options can have a default value set in the above specified config file.
.PP
Options specific to \fBsync\fR command:
.TP
\fB\-\-delete\-removed\fR
Delete remote objects with no corresponding local file when \fIsync\fRing \fBto\fR S3 or delete local files with no corresponding object in S3 when \fIsync\fRing \fBfrom\fR S3.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-delete\-removed\fR
Don't delete remote objects. Default for 'sync' command.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-preserve\fR
Preserve filesystem attributes (mode, ownership, timestamps). Default for 'sync' command.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-preserve\fR
Don't store filesystem attributes with uploaded files.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude GLOB\fR
Exclude files matching GLOB (a.k.a. shell-style wildcard) from \fIsync\fI. See SYNC COMMAND section for more information.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\-from FILE\fR
Same as \-\-exclude but reads GLOBs from the given FILE instead of expecting them on the command line.
.TP
\fB\-\-rexclude REGEXP\fR
Same as \-\-exclude but works with REGEXPs (Regular expressions).
.TP
\fB\-\-rexclude\-from FILE\fR
Same as \-\-exclude\-from but works with REGEXPs.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\-syncmatch\fR or \fB\-\-debug\-exclude\fR (alias)
Display detailed information about matching file names against exclude\-rules as well as information about remote vs local filelists matching. S3cmd exits after performing the match and no actual transfer takes place.
.\".TP
.\"\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
.\"Only show what would be uploaded or downloaded but don't actually do it. May still perform S3 requests to get bucket listings and other information though.
.PP
Options common for all commands (where it makes sense indeed):
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Force overwrite and other dangerous operations.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-acl\-public\fR
Store objects with permissions allowing read for anyone.
.TP
\fB\-\-acl\-private\fR
Store objects with default ACL allowing access for you only.
.TP
\fB\-\-bucket\-location\fR=BUCKET_LOCATION
Specify datacentre where to create the bucket. Possible values are \fIUS\fR (default) or \fIEU\fR.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-encrypt\fR

.TP
\fB\-m\fR MIME/TYPE, \fB\-\-mime\-type\fR=MIME/TYPE
Default MIME\-type to be set for objects stored.
.TP

.SH SYNC COMMAND
One of the most powerful commands of \fIs3cmd\fR is \fBs3cmd sync\fR used for 
synchronising complete directory trees to or from remote S3 storage. 
.PP
Basic usage common in backup scenarios is as simple as:
.nf
	s3cmd sync /local/path s3://test-bucket/backup
.fi
.PP
This command will find all files under /local/path directory and copy them 
to corresponding paths under s3://test-bucket/backup on the remote side.
For example:
.nf
/local/path\fB/file1.ext\fR         ->  s3://test-bucket/backup\fB/file1.ext\fR
/local/path\fB/dir123/file2.bin\fR  ->  s3://test-bucket/backup\fB/dir123/file2.bin\fR
.fi

To retrieve the files back from S3 use inverted syntax:
.nf
	s3cmd sync s3://test-bucket/backup/ /tmp/restore
.fi
that will download files:
.nf
s3://test-bucket/backup\fB/file1.ext\fR         ->  /tmp/restore\fB/file1.ext\fR       
s3://test-bucket/backup\fB/dir123/file2.bin\fR  ->  /tmp/restore\fB/dir123/file2.bin\fR
.fi

For the purpose of \fB\-\-exclude\fR and \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fR matching the file name 
\fIalways\fR begins with \fB/\fR (slash) and has the local or remote common part removed.
For instance in the previous example the file names tested against --exclude list
will be \fB/\fRfile1.ext and \fB/\fRdir123/file2.bin, that is both with the leading 
slash regardless whether you specified s3://test-bucket/backup or 
s3://test-bucket/backup/ (note the trailing slash) on the command line.

Both \fB\-\-exclude\fR and \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fR work with shell-style wildcards (a.k.a. GLOB).
For a greater flexibility s3cmd provides Regular-expression versions of the two exclude options 
named \fB\-\-rexclude\fR and \fB\-\-rexclude\-from\fR. 

Run s3cmd with \fB\-\-debug\-syncmatch\fR to get detailed information
about matching file names against exclude rules.

For example to exclude all files with ".bin" extension with a REGEXP use:
.PP
	\-\-rexclude '\.bin$'
.PP
to exclude all hidden files and subdirectories (i.e. those whose name begins with dot ".") use GLOB:
.PP
	\-\-exclude '/.*'
.PP
on the other hand to exclude only hidden files but not hidden subdirectories use REGEXP:
.PP
	\-\-rexclude '/\.[^/]*$'
.PP
etc...
