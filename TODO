TODO list for s3cmd project
===========================

- For 0.9.9
  - Enable --exclude for [del]
  - Enable --dry-run for [del], reject for all others.
  - Sync should work for one file, for example
    s3cmd sync /etc/passwd s3://bucket/passwd
  - Add testsuite for new put, get and sync semantic.
  - Recursive cp/mv on remote "folders".
  - Document --recursive and --force for buckets, CloudFront,
    new options --dry-run, --include, etc.
  - Allow change /tmp to somewhere else
  - With --guess-mime use 'magic' module if available.

- For 1.0.0
  - Add 'geturl' command, both Unicode and urlencoded output.

- After 1.0.0
  - Speed up upload / download with multiple threads.
  - Sync should be able to update metadata (UID, timstamps, etc)
    if only these change (i.e. same content, different metainfo).
  - Sync must backup non-files as well. At least directories, 
    symlinks and device nodes.
  - If GPG fails error() and exit. If un-GPG fails save the 
    file with .gpg extension.
  - Keep backup files remotely on put/sync-to if requested 
    (move the old 'object' to e.g. 'object~' and only then upload 
     the new one). Could be more advanced to keep, say, last 5 
     copies, etc.

- Implement GPG for sync
  (it's not that easy since it won't be easy to compare
   the encrypted-remote-object size with local file. 
   either we can store the metadata in a dedicated file 
   where we face a risk of inconsistencies, or we'll store
   the metadata encrypted in each object header where we'll
   have to do large number for object/HEAD requests. tough 
   call).
  Or we can only compare local timestamps with remote object 
  timestamps. If the local one is older we'll *assume* it 
  hasn't been changed.

- Keep man page up to date and write some more documentation
  - Yeah, right ;-)
