TODO list for s3cmd project
===========================

- Treat objects with "/" in their name as directories
  - Will need local cache for bucket listings
  - More user friendly 'del' operation that would work
    with "directories"
  - Recursion for some commands

- Implement 'sync' from S3 to local filesystem
  - Will have to restore file attributes
    - Eh, we have to store them first ;-)

- Implement GPG for sync
  (it's not that easy since it won't be easy to compare
   the encrypted-remote-object size with local file. 
   either we can store the metadata in a dedicated file 
   where we face a risk of inconsistencies, or we'll store
   the metadata encrypted in each object header where we'll
   have to do large number for object/HEAD requests. tough 
   call).

- Compute MD5 checksum when sending file to S3 
  (that's easy and patch exists but it will slow down 
   the operation. instead I'm planning to run the 
   MD5-summor in a separate thread since both MD5-summing
   and sending data to S3 can both be time consuming yet 
   parallel tasks).
